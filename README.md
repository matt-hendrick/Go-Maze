# Some Go Maze Solving

![Maze GIF](mazeDemo.gif)

This is an experiment with some maze pathfinding algorithms to help me learn the basics of Go.

In the current implementation, a maze is generated in Go and three different algorithms (DFS, BFS, A\*) are used to solve it. The path those algorithms followed through the maze is then injected into HTML and the paths visualized with some simple JavaScript.
