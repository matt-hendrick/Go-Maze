# Some Go Maze Solving

This is an experiment with some maze pathfinding algorithms to help me learn Go. The current code is rough, but this just a useful exercise for learning the basics of Go.

In the current implementation, a maze is generated in Go and three different algorithms used to solve it. The path those algorithms followed through the maze is then injected into HTML and the paths visualized with some simple JavaScript.
